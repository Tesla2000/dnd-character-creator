From a young age, he was taught the importance of strength and resilience, not just in crafting weapons, but in life itself. When his village was threatened by marauding bandits, Thrain took up arms to protect his home. He quickly became known for his unwavering defense and his ability to absorb blows that would fell lesser warriors. After successfully driving away the bandits, he decided to dedicate his life to becoming a master of heavy armor and shield techniques. Now, he travels the land, seeking to hone his skills in battle and defend those who cannot protect themselves. His heart is as strong as the steel he wields, and he believes that true strength lies in protecting others.",
